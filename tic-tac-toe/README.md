# Tic-Tac-Toe

## About

This project was done for Dr. Kostadin Damevski's CMSC 355 Software Engineering class at VCU. This app looks like a tic-tac-toe game on the surface, but it is actually much more. It is designed as a prank to play on your friends that will make you look like a tic-tac-toe savant!

## How it works

Just starting the game normally brings you into the "impossible" game mode. In this game mode, the human player will never win. The computer will be programmed to always win/tie the game. You can give it to your friends and let them try to win. It won’t take long before they realize it is impossible.

However, you know the trick! Do the secret gesture (three finger swipe – ‘w’ key on emulator) to activate the “easy” game mode. In this game mode, you will be able to win (if you know how to play tic-tac-toe).

Your friends won’t believe how easy it is for you to win. You can give it back to them (after doing the secret gesture again), and they won’t be able to win! They will think that you are a tic-tac-toe genius!
