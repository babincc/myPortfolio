# VCU Scavenger Hunt

### About:

This app was created as a semester long project in Dr. David Shepherd's CMSC 491 UI Design and Implementation class at VCU. It is a scavenger hunt game for Android phones that will take the user all over the VCU Monroe Park campus to find different locations.

The goal of this app is to make the user more familiar with VCU. You will learn some history about the school, where to go for fun, places to eat, and much more. Once you finish the game, you should be comfortable on the VCU campus.

**DOWNLOAD:** Go to the Google Play Store to download the [VCU Scavenger Hunt (external link)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.uxuiclass.vcuscavengerhunt&hl=en_US&gl=US) app (assuming Google hasn't taken it down for inactivity).

### Instructions:

Once you click "Play" you will be shown a list of categories. You can choose and category and start hunting! Inside of each category are lists of places to find. You click on a place and are given a question about that place. Each question will have an answer that will become obvious once you arrive at the proper location. Once you have your answer, you can submit it to find out if you are correct. Correct answers will be rewarded Rodney Ram coins (you can count your coins in "Profile"). The game is complete once you find every location and correctly answer each question.

### Penalties:

Each question is initially worth 100 Rodney Ram coins; however, each time you answer a question incorrectly, its value drops by 10 coins.
