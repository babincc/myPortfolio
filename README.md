# My Portfolio

This repository is a sample of some of my work. Each folder is its own project and there will be a README file in each one to give a detailed description of the project. Below is a summary of each project in this repository.

## Download options

### Option 1

You can download this entire repo just like any other GitHub repo.

### Option 2

Each project is available for individual download from the [Downloads](downloads.md) page. There will be a link to each project's downloadable .zip folder. This gives you that one project as if it were its own GitHub repo.

### Option 3

To download runnable versions of these programs (if they are available) you will have to go to the project's folder (linked below) and see what the README has to say about downloads.
