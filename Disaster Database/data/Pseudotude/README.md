# Pseudotude
Current version: v1.0.0

<br>

Pseudotude (Pseudo - Longitude/Latitude) is a program designed to generate longitude and latitude coordinate ranges for each location. It will go though list of locations and generate a unique longitude and latitude pair for each of them. These entries are meant to be used for my CMSC 508 semester project and are not real data.

To use this program, you must first download the "src" folder. Then, make sure you have the locations file you want to read from in the "FILE_NAME" string in the /main/Gen_A_Tude.java file; the location data input file must also be in the "src" folder. Once that is done, run the /main/Gen_A_Tude.java file in the command prompt/terminal. After it runs, it will have generated a new .csv file with all of the locations and their new coordinates.

NOTE: If the input file name is "mixed_location_data.csv", it will be overridden by the file that this program produces.
