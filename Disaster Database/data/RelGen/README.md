Current version: v1.0.0

<br>

RelGen (Relief Generator) is a program designed to generate relief campaign data entries based on the disasters provided to it. These entries are meant to be used for my CMSC 508 semester project and are not real data.

To use this program, you will need to download the "src" folder and compile the "Gen_A_Relief.java" file (/src/main/Gen_A_Relief.java) in the command prompt/terminal. You will need to make sure that the most up to date "real_relief-agency_data.csv" file and "real_supply-items_data.csv" file in the "src" folder as well as all of the disaster files you are generating relief campaigns for (you will need to manually add those disaster files into the code as well). You will then need to run the "Gen_A_Relief.class" file (/src/main/Gen_A_Relief.class). After it runs, it will have generated two .csv files with all of your newly generated relief campaign data for the disasters provided to it and the supplies used in those relief efforts.
