# Problem Statement (draft)

The world we live in is very dangerous. There are deadly disasters happening every day, and it seems like there is nothing we can do to avoid them. All we can do is hope that we don't become a statistic. Hopefully, this project ends that way of thinking. Hopefully, it will be able to show people how to stay safe in our dangerous world.

The goal of this project is to gather and analyze data about the most common, deadly disasters around the world. This information will be used to find patterns and correlations with disasters and survival rates. The hope is that this research will give some insight into how to survive a deadly situation and better yet how to avoid them altogether.

This project will look into the most common natural disasters and manmade disasters. Natural disasters include weather events such as tornadoes, hurricanes, and floods as well as other lethal acts of nature such as earthquakes and landslides. Manmade disasters will include accidents like plane crashes as well as purposeful attacks like shootings. Some of these topics can get very dark, but remember, the goal is to let people know how to be safe in these situations and try to make the world a more survivable place.

Eventually, the goal is to have this database be used by the government and other powerful groups that are in charge of public safety. The hope is that this database will be able to save lives someday. Since governments won't look at this database right away, it will have to be given to the people so they can educate themselves. This database is for everyone. With enough people concerned for the wellbeing of the public, they may be able to lobby and get this database into legislative groups. There is where it will have the most chance to actually help people.

Individuals and communities will have a database storing information regarding natural disasters happening locally and around the world. This database will contain information regarding the types of disasters that have occurred, as well as the time, location, and the damage that was caused. Aggregate data will allow users to be better informed about the type of hazards that exist in their area, as well as being able to recognize patterns across time. This information will help mitigate future damage to infrastructure, ease financial burdens, and prevent loss of life by allowing users to be informed and prepared.

This database may be used by local officials, government bodies, data scientists, the broader scientific community, and concerned individuals.

Operations on the database will include:
- Entering the type of disaster that happened
- Entering the location of the disaster
- Entering the time the disaster occurred
- Entering the damage done by the disaster

The entity sets for the database are:
- Disaster Type
- Location
- Damage Done
- Time of Disaster
