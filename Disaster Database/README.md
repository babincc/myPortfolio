# Disaster Database

This project was done for Dr. Debra Duke's CMSC 508 Database Theory class at VCU.

## Project Summary and Goals

- Create a database that contributes to a solution to a real-world problem
  - Data topic: Natural and man-made disasters
  - The data can be found [here](data)
- Devise 20 or more questions that can be answered by the data
  - These question can be found [here](documentation/phase%202%20final%20problem%20statement.md#queries)
- Write SQL queries that go through the data and collect the necessary information to answer those 20 questions
  - These queries can be found [here](SQL%20scripts/queries.sql)
- Create a web UI that allows users to interact with the database
  - The code for that web UI can be found [here](web%20interface)

## Repo Layout

**[SQL scripts](SQL%20scripts)** - This is where the SQL scripts are stored.

**[data](data)** - This is where the data and data generators are stored. This is the data that is in the database.

**[database tables](database%20tables)** - This is where the tables and table generators are stored. These tables are what the database looks like. It is how the information is stored in the database.

**[design diagrams](design%20diagrams)** - This is where the design diagrams are stored. This includes e-r diagrams, relational schemas, and any other visual representation of the database.

**[documentation](documentation)** - This is where the documentation for the project is stored. This includes the problem statement, queries, and any other documentation or important notes that deal with the database.

**[web interface](web%20interface)** - This is where the website files are stored. This site is used to interact with the database using a slightly more GUI-like environment.
