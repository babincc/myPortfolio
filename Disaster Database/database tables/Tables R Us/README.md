# Tables R Us
Current version: v1.0.0

<br>

Tables R Us is a program designed to create tables based on the data generated by DisGen, RelGen, and Pseudotude. These will be what the database looks like. This program will create .csv files that mirror the database. These tables are meant to be used for my CMSC 508 semester project and are not necessarily real data.

To use this program, you will need to download the "src" folder and compile the "Tables_R_Us.java" file (/src/main/Tables_R_Us.java) in the command prompt/terminal. You will need to make sure that you have all of the most up to date data files from GitHub in the "src" folder. You will then need to run the "Tables_R_Us.class" file (/src/main/Gen_A_Relief.class). After it runs, it will have generated several .csv files. Each one is a relationship from the normalized relational schema.
