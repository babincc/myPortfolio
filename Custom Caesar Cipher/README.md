# Custom Caesar Cipher

Current Version: v1.0.0

This program is my take on a traditional Caesar Cipher.

Rather than offsetting a regular alphabet by a certain number, I wanted the user
to essentially be able to remove the inner disc and replace it with a custom
jumbled alphabet; this would further obfuscate the message. Once the user
selects their custom alphabet, they will also be able to shift it however many
spaces they would like, to make it even harder to decode.

This is by no means a high security encryption algorithm. This is a fun project
which can be used to send "secret" messages with friends. Do not use this for
real security purposes.
